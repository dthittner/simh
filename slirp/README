This version of slirp is a fork from QEMU Version 2.4.0.1 slirp implementation
Taken from commit 474590efc51f262fb5d81ca417d510cb7fb7a914 
in the qemu repository git://repo.or.cz/qemu/ar7.git

The goal being to absolutely mininize changes from the base qemu provided code 
so that the more active changes being done by the qemu folks can easily be 
adopted in the future by directly replacing the revised modules.  This is 
achieved by careful manipulation of the include files provided in the 
slirp/qemu directory so that things are stubbed out locally and the minimal 
capabilities needed for sim_ether integration are provided.

Thanks to Fabrice Bellard.
